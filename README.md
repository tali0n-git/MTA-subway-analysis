# MTA Subway Data Analysis

This project analyzes data from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) subway system in New York City. The analysis focuses on customer journey times, train delays, and other performance metrics to understand the efficiency and reliability of subway services.

## Files in this Project

* `data` (csv files): The CSV files where DataFrames will be generated from.
* notebooks: Jupyter notebooks (5) for data exploration and analysis.
* `mta-att-apipy`: The access point of our MTA api, JSON data. Was not implemented in the analysis but is available for future use.
* 'README.md': This file, which provides an overview of the project and answers to analytical questions.

## Questions:

1. How punctual/consistent are the trains in each borough? -Jahaira
2. Does weather have an influence on train delays? -Thalyann
3. Is there a difference in service time between off-peak and peak service periods? -Rosania
    a. What influence does the number of passengers have with train punctuality?
4. How did passenger experience (measured by delays and journey time performance) change over subway lines and time? - Mina
5. How do average platform and train delays change over time, and what months experience the worst performance in 2020-2024? -Jessica


# Recommendations for the MTA
1. Weather Preparedness: Implement strategies to mitigate the impact of adverse weather conditions on train delays.
2. Peak vs Off-Peak Analysis: MTA should consider adjusting service frequency during peak hours to accommodate increased passenger volume.
3. Passenger Experience: MTA should prioritize improving passenger experience by addressing delays and journey time performance. (How?)
